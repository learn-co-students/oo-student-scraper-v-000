Scraper
	- It's job is to get raw data from the website.
	- It does it in 2 ways
		- First the scrape_index_page should return an array of hashes, each has with some basic student info (profile URL being the most important)
		- then we have scrape_profile_page which gets an individuals complete info.


		scrape_index_page => [{:url => "student_1.html"}, {:url => "student_2.html"}]
			for each url in the return value of scrape_index_page
				we're going pass the URL to scrape_profile_page
				scrape_profile_page is then going to return to us all the students information , a big hash {:name => }


		Student class.
			The student class is suppose to store the data of a student.

Scraper is going to give us raw data and then make a bunch of Student instances
